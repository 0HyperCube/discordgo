Golang DiscordApp API.

This is my first Golang project and it is probably not even suitable for use :)
Everything here so far is likely to change as I learn Golang better and refine the API names and such.

Initially my goal was to write a chatbot and I started working with https://github.com/Xackery/discord as my API.  But that code doesn't work 100% and so I started slowly making changes to it.  Anyhow, credit goes to https://github.com/Xackery/discord for getting me started.
